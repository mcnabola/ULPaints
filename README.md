Python learning and discovery journal, whilst producing a semi-useful software.

## Objective 
As you can see from the image below this is what a project to use a new different style of media sharing would look like. You could play games like tetris, you could use block text to write messives or create pixel art movies and stream them to the wall.

In the finished project there would be light panels behind each section of the windows and they could be controlled remotely to turn on and off and display colours on demand.

Eventually my thought process turned to how are you going to have someones idea for a image or movie and convert that into what you see on the wall. I always liked the idea of Paint, MSPaint had my attention for a lot of my childhood. So I wanted to create something like Paint but for drawing block art that could be used for the project of controlling a wall of light.
